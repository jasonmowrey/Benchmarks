# Benchmarks
This set of Python code is written based on the original SAS code that replicates the DGTW (1997) characteristics-based benchmarks. Please refer to the original DGTW page for detailed discussion on methodology. The flow of the code and the dataset naming convention mimics the SAS code for easy cross-reference.
